                    <div class="content"><p>Copied a answer to a related question ,thought it might have more utility as a seperate post. </p>

<p>Question: "I was thinking of developing a community driven desi superhero with its own expansive lore with themes that are inspired by real events that relate to desi Diaspora do you think this is Interesting if so what should be the name of this character?" </p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<p>Long answer. Kanha (krishna's nickname) for a affectionate nickname. Rudra (god of storms manifestaion of Shiva) if you want it to be more warrior like/stormy/destructive vibes. Narashimah (half beast avatar of Vishnu) for connecting him to a ancient badass lore/beastial vibes. Indranadi "Indra's river- ala river that conducts Indra's lightning" for a scion of Indra connected in some way to the legendray archer Arjuna, the son of Indra. There can be hundreds of options if you stop "focusing" on a narrow idea (and I'm not even that knowledgable of hindu mythology).</p>

<p>Also why "a" superhero? Hopefully your character isn't a token MC in a americanized "diverse" cast. China/japan's success with their mytholgical games and success of shows like shang chi have showed that you can have a full fledged cast of east asian characters. I'm not saying don't set it up in America or europe, but make sure it has a lot of Indian/desi male characters, and make sure there are non- indian/desi women in pivotal roles with Indian myhtoligical abilities (Indranadi is a feminine sounding name, and would eprfectly suit a white women wirth powerful lightning abilities) and in relationships with/have sexual tension with(even if they are enemies) with the Indian male heroes/villians.</p>

<p>The show/story should center around female gaze, an awful need of the hour for SA men: Make sure the Indian guys (hero/villians) all cater to the female gaze. So hero's can have 1) krishna/shiva like vibe-moderate chiseled build but extremely op, long hair with adornememnts (feather,flower,moon, water fountain), peaceful aura, good at playing music or dancing, caring and protective towards women 2) younger Devas/Indra like vibe- Haughty, extremely tall and muscular ,giving the vibes of the wattapad mafia boss that doesn't give a fuck about women, but gradually softening/opening up towards women if interacted with on a regular basis. 3)Bramha/older gods- eperienced, mature father figure types.</p>

<p>Same for villians 1) dont depict them like they are traditionally depicted in Indian media, with the hyperuscular build, cringe mustache and all- they should cater to female gaze too- they should evoke the "If villian why hot" meme. 1)"Monster " manga/Joahnn liebert like villian : Standing voluminous hair, dark circles in eyes, lean build, perpetual frown (like the guy int this wallpaper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVk1W_Jo3oI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVk1W_Jo3oI</a> ) extremely sadisitc, cruel and dread inducing aura 2) Shounen like villian: Muscular with a french cut (again dont go for the dumb 3m long mustache) and more vocal about his evil intentions than option 1 , but still not to the extent of a typical shounen character (the more a charcater yaps unnecessarily, the more the audience/women starts not taking him serious) 3) Fromsoft style villian: that would force women to say ""why am I attracted to this, what is wrong with me"- eldritch horrors that can take the form of attractive men, or walking nightmares/ultra diseased men that are extrememly attractive (eg. malenia(rotted body), messemer((snakes crawling inside body) from elden ring). Hope these would be good enough for a starting point.</p>
