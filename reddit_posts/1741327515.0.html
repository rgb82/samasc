                    <div class="content"><p>I was scrolling through Reddit to only see a lot of south asian women raising their voices about how they have been belittled by south asian men and how ugly they feel because of us. A lot of them from many subreddits like Vindicta outright are asking to date outside of the culture. A lot of them promote to not date brown men. Why do these women hate brown men so much? I'll not completely disregard their concerns that are being shamed by South Asian men (there might be some truth to it) 
These women really have deep-rooted hatred against us and our culture. I'd tolerate hatred against us but not against the culture simply because these women do not have any idea about the true customs, traditions and nuances that the culture brings in. 
Also a simple pattern recognition shows that these women specifically only want to date white men and not men of any other culture. Why is that so? </p>
