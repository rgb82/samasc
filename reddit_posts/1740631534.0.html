                    <div class="content"><p>Bro the other day at a party, I was talking to this lightskin dominican shawty and some brown dude walks up to me and says "brodie how the girl that ur parents set u up with feeling bout this" I almost fought this kid until shawty was tellin me not to cause he seemed autistic in her eyes (shes a special education major so I trusted her). </p>

<p>Whenever I show girls I've got with or that I'm talking to my friends. My white boys always encourage me to pursue them, my Spanish friends always the ones usually lining me up with two mans and putting me on with girls. My Indian friends, of course not all of them but some of them be on some weird shi. Like one time I posted some girl in the gc and they all said "bro shes a bop". One of them told me some weird shi that I only pull cause I make myself look black. One time at a frat I saw two brown dudes tryna cockblock each other from some blonde white girl. </p>
