                    <div class="content"><p>I know it has been years but I will never forgive that fool for the dehumanising things he made about our people and turning it into a viral inter-generational meme that still stands today and clearly I'm not the only person that feels this way. I think PR will slowly improve but it will need big YouTubers (Nelk etc) to continue to post good things. Bald &amp; Bankrupts old videos on India were good and very insightful, but as soon as he teamed up with that "Small Brained American" guy (truly lives up to his name), he decided to join the hate train too. Seeing all the drama with the US, Ukraine, Russia etc is entertaining and now peoples feeds are memes of Zelenskyy instead of stupid reels about our food and people. The next few years of politics and meme culture are gonna be about Trump, NATO, the EU and Putin. This timeline is interesting and I think we will be off the spotlight unlike 2023-24.</p>
