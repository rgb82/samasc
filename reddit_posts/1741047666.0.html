                    <div class="content"><p>I am was thinking and curious to know if it's a South Asian perents thing maybe or an individual case for me</p>

<p>I try my best to please my parents as much as possible, but i have noticed a lot, i rather get to hear complaints or just never an appreciation, and it sometimes makes me  just more distanced  and sad, especially my mom seems always more unsatisfied with me - where im like... I'm doing what I can </p>
