                    <div class="content"><p>Lately, I have been pondering about this topic, and as a South Asian male, it has been incredibly depressing to realize this. South Asian men are the only group of people based on race and gender that have absolutely ZERO content creators on the internet based on any entertaining content, and yes, there are plenty of even South Asian women and Middle Easterners (both men and women) who create entertaining content. By entertaining content, I am talking about gaming, anime, reaction vids, cosplay, car content, vacation vlogs, comedy skits, parodies, etc, basically nothing academic, professional, nor religious. And sadly, us South Asian men are the only group without any representatives for said content creation. Instead, we have no one but STeM tutors (even more so computer science). Every time I get excited to see a South Asian male on social media, I immediately find out that it's just another STeM tutoring page and therefore has no entertaining content, thus leading to disappointment. Since this is how it is currently and every South Asian male content creator is some copy or slight variation of Sajjaad Khader, it's no wonder we are either a laughingstock or completely ignored in the online world.</p>

<p>And sadly, it doesn't get any better. Instead, fellow South Asian men go on to brag about academic achievements (such as master's degrees or PhD's solely to rub it in everyone else's faces and make them feel inferior over not studying hard enough). All they do is bring shame to us all because everyone mocks us South Asian men in part for having no representatives for fun content creators and for being the only group without any such representatives. </p>

<p>Us South Asian men need to stop with being defined by our academics and professional matters and we need to do better and actually keep up with everyone else in terms of fun content creation instead of being just STeM tutors online, because every other group is doing a fantastic job at not letting academics nor professionalism define them.</p>
