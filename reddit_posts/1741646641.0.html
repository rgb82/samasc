                    <div class="content"><p>29 M, desi, 6', decent fit, good BMI (defn not skinny). my dating life is pretty non-existent and i feel super frustrated and lonely. i'm a PhD student in STEM (final year) at a small-town uni in USA, where most people are undergrads. i've got some dating experience from back in india, but here it's been rough. i've been trying for years but it just feels like nothing's working.</p>

<p>every friend i know is either dating or has a partner, so it's extremely lonely. tried the mutual friends route and failed there too.</p>

<p>i'm balding, and although i've tried full shave multiple times, it doesn't really suit/work for me. i prefer a trimmed style with my thick beard, even though i've got a large forehead. i've been working out and focusing on myself, dressing up decent, tryna up my social life by putting myself out there, askin &amp; talking to people, but i still end up getting none, or if i get some rarely, i get ghosted after few smalltalk. dating apps ofc never worked.</p>

<p>social events here are mostly full of much younger people, so i feel like i'm either too young or too old. I am pretty much a nerd, philosophy &amp; movie buff, i talk well, and have got my fair bit of hobbies like guitar, calisthenics. but, clubs are packed with undergrads who seem to judge me based on my looksâ€”yeah, i do look older. i've also been goin to local church events, but i've only come across families or couples.</p>

<p>with final year, job search &amp; parents back home forcing me into arranged marriage that i really dislike, i am literally running against time, anxiety is high...so pls help.</p>

<p>any tips on how to up my dating game? what worked &amp; what didnt work for ya? what specific steps can i take to improve my prospects?</p>
