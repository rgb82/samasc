                    <div class="content"><p>As much as I don't believe there are separate fashion tips for straight men, perception matters to an extent. So what are some fashion tips for straight men?</p>

<p>Specs: 6 feet tall, wears rimless power glasses (contact lens sucks, not a practical option), broad shoulders, lean muscular (which means my physique and muscles won't be visible unless I wear tight fitting clothes), gym 3x a week</p>

<p>My current dressing is formals for 5 days/week office, collared polo t shirt or casual tee or casual shirt with contrasting coloured chinos (light t shirt and dark chinos and vice versa) for going out.</p>

<p>Just some dressing tips, grooming tips and colour combination suggestions would help a lot. Please come with suggestions!</p>
