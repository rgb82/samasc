                    <div class="content"><p>I ended a 2 year relationship recently when I learnt of my gf's undergraduate wild promiscuous phase. It felt like too much to take especially when she told me she wants to wait till marriage.</p>

<p>My parents don't know the reason for the break up but know about it. Since then they have been pushing arranged marriage to me as soon as I finish my masters. </p>

<p>Now I'm seriously considering it. I'm wondering how much of a leeway can be given to a girl regarding her past, so that there is still a good marriage. </p>

<p>P.S. I'm currently in the US but will probably go back to India given the current environment. </p>
