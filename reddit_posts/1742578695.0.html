                    <div class="content"><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I am not as active as I want to be out here, but past June-July, you all have given me advice on looks and confidence and all that. I took part in some of that. I am a 22M who never dated or hooked up prior to Fall 2024, but a lot has changed since then in these past 8 or so months (at least on the dating end), and I once again need help. </p>

<p>UPDATES</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that I've done and a lot left to do, but below are my updates (losses really) from dating. Most are from Hinge and some IRL. They are mostly South Asian/White women, but I'm open to all, just that's all I have for now.</p>

<p>Of course I have been ghosted, unmatched, rejected but out of decent talking stages and dates, I've lost out on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A girl who deals with weird exes (assaulted etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>A girl who doesn't like my humor but likes everything else.</p></li>
<li><p>A girl can't get over a TALKING stage when he cut things off.</p></li>
<li><p>A girl tells me to text her then says she sucks at texting when I do.</p></li>
<li><p>A girl wants to hookup like really quick repeatedly when I'm insecure/unsure with all this albeit I will say I also think I am a little more slow/mature, have standards, and raised relatively conservatively (tbh I didn't like her at all, but it was an interaction in this phase of my life).</p></li>
<li><p>A girl tells me long distance won't work even though I put in all I can because of her trauma with long distance?</p></li>
<li><p>Similar to above, a girl I talk with forever says she needs proximity EVEN before we go on dates. I put in all the effort I can here.</p></li>
<li><p>A girl says let's go on a date and then ghosts me in the build-up. Then tries to gaslight me into being a little sad about that.</p></li>
<li><p>A girl says she doesn't have emotional battery after talking with me.</p></li>
<li><p>A girl who cannot get over an ex after multiple dates with me (similar to above).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>REFLECTION</p>

<p>What do you all think? Outside of going like 0/100 with the people I've met who ghosted, rejected, unmatched etc., I am 0/10 with the stages beyond that.</p>

<p>I think I've gotten a little better looking, picked up 10 lbs of muscle though body fat remains heavy (recomp, but no diet or cardio), so I plan on cutting. I still have a lot of insecurities, and feel like my brain is a little too slow for all this (I'm weird haha). I think on many regards I'm probably below average in everything physical, maybe not my height, and my looks maybe less and less (girls have called me attractive)? But I think a lot of it is changing and will keep changing because of the effort I put with. I do think I am smart, charismatic, funny etc; skills that I've improved on from my rut. I also think I've become more self-confident.</p>

<p>At the same time, I cannot sustain a relationship that does not benefit me at all. I have standards. I want to commit and grow with someone who will accept me, but at the same time I want to get better for me. My mental health tanked last year (HEAVY), but we crawling out of it through therapy and reflection. Now there's some professional and more self-growth focuses to do. More hobbies I want to do, more professional jobs I want to do, more school plans etc. If I woke up tomorrow in a relationship, none of that will be fixed, BUT I want to be better so I can be enough for someone? </p>

<p>There are some advantages, I'm south asian (obviously), in a community (East) that is not my home (West) and I plan on going to further education and will have more like-minded people through my plans in more close-off environments compared to a lot of others. I've already been working in environments like that, and I see the change in people; I just haven't really maximized any progress during this transitory period in those environments.</p>

<p>QUESTIONS</p>

<p>What do you guys think? How do I cope with this failure? How do I get better? What should I do? I really just want someone serious, someone I can mutually win with (Michelangelo effect)? Can I really be accepted by someone after failing so much? All this is even before seriously dating people or sex or anything. Sure, there's no rush for me on that; everyone in my family is married and I won't be a slouch, but it's about growth that I need help on.</p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p>
