                    <div class="content"><p>I'm a 28-year-old man (M) from a Punjabi family, and for the past year, my wife (28F) and I have been living with my parents. We both have stable, well-paying jobs and can easily afford to rent or even buy a place. But here's the thing: I’ve never lived on my own. As the eldest son, it's been expected that I stay with my parents and help out where I can (or what I’ve been told). My parents are financially stable.</p>

<p>We’ve had our own room and a TV area downstairs, but we still share the kitchen and the main floor with my parents and siblings. My wife gets along with my parents well, even though we have different ideologies and ways of thinking. But despite the good relationship, I’ve come to the realization that it’s time for us to move out.</p>

<p>The problem is, I know my parents will guilt-trip me into staying. They’ve always said things like, “You won’t take care of us when we get older,” or “We built this house for you guys.” I completely understand where they’re coming from. They’ve worked so hard, immigrating from Punjab and building a life for us here in AB. I’m incredibly grateful for everything they’ve done for me.</p>

<p>But here’s where it gets complicated: my dad can be passive-aggressive and, when he drinks, he gets childish and stubborn. It's like he shuts down, listens to no one’s reason, and can become really frustrating to deal with. On top of that, my mom is extremely emotional and often takes the blame for everything – whether it's her fault or not. If we don’t agree with her or make mistakes, she immediately blames herself.</p>

<p>I feel stuck between wanting to honour my parents’ sacrifices and create a space for my wife and me to thrive. The guilt is overwhelming, and I’m afraid of their reaction if I move out. I don’t want to hurt my parents, but I also know that we need to build our own life, and I feel it’s time to take that next step toward independence.</p>

<p>I also want to stress that my wife is not the reason I want to move out. While I know my parents might assume it’s because of her, it’s actually my decision to take the next step in our lives. She’s been supportive of me throughout this process, but it’s about creating our own space and building the foundation for our future together, especially before starting our own family.</p>

<p>Now, I’m trying to figure out how to bring this up with them. I know this conversation is going to be difficult. How do I communicate that the decision has already been made without making them feel like I'm abandoning them? I want to be respectful and honest, but I’m not sure how to approach this in a way that won't turn into a huge emotional conflict. </p>

<p>Any advice or suggestions on how to approach this tough conversation would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>TIA!</p>
