                    <div class="content"><p>You're not a woman, you're not at the beach or at a park, please wear proper footwear in certain places. Seriously we get clowned all over the world for our very casual approach to clothing and I still see mfs (fobs mainly) rocking sandals in winter. Its cringe seeing guys wear this in places where they aren't supposed to. Also, it is a hygiene issue, (when working with food especially), you can find cases of people getting fired for wearing this whilst working at a restaurant. </p>
