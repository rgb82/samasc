<p>Most Indians in qts are angrily using anti wignat memes, and other guys in the qts are shaming white people in general , but it's actually a black guy (clear from post history) This is a pattern I've noticed where Black men's (and men's only , black women's racism is more along the "men ain't shit" = "indian men ain't shit" line) racism is far more "visceral" against Indian men than racism from other ethinicities ,in a sense. </p>

<p>I remember a viral reply to an "increase in male suicide rates across the years" stat, and a black dude said it was because of Indian immigration and "indian n *ggas not getting any". And then corrected it with "I don't hate Indians or Indian culture, Indian women bad as hell and they look gorgeous in Indian attire" but "all" the indian men he knows are incels and don't get any .I've found black men more than any other race, even whites, employ this "women are baddies, men are replusive" rhetoric, while also dehumanising black women. Indian women, because they have the lowest self esteem of all races of women, are more likely to take this rhetoric as "appreciation" compared to, say even asian women- who would always troll black men whenever they made those "seeing asian baddie with mid white dude " reels. </p>

<p>Or this one <a href="https://x.com/realrxAFC/status/1894267111809454351">https://x.com/realrxAFC/status/1894267111809454351</a> </p>

<p>I have a theory that black and to some extent hispanic men engage in this "kiss up, kick down" rhetoric that tries to place them as "second best " after whites is because they <strong>only</strong> have soft power- they dont' have any hard power, either in their ancestral homelands, or in the diapsora, that they can kang over (unlike whites , asians or Indians) so the only viable "insult" they can think about against an asian or Indian dude is "your own women don't want you/ would fuck anybody but you" or "you are the least desirable race of men/most hated demographic " respectively. The "muh d* ck" meme, if you have seen it, exists for a reason regarding black guys, because they make everything about dicks and desirability.</p>
