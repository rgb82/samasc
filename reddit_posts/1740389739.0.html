                    <div class="content"><p>In America, no matter what colour you are, as long as you have that passport, you are American. People see you as American especially if you sound American and people usually won't ask stupid shit like "where are you really from?" I'm not downplaying you American bros experiences but most of you are doing quite well. Australia, New Zealand and the UK are a bit different, I've been to all these countries and I can see the differences in what people consider Australian/Kiwi/English vs American. In Australia for example, there was a white Australia policy until 1971, 1/3rd of the current Aussie population was still alive back then. Australia as a convict country was vastly white until around the 90s and is still very much attached to its Anglo identity. Doesn't matter how much the country "progresses" you only see white people in ads/movies and if there is a person of colour it's usually the chick whilst the dude is white. You won't be considered Aussie here if you're not anglo, even white Italians/Greeks aren't considered Aussie here they have their own term "wog". America is also much more diverse overall and has taken in foreign immigration for a longer time than Aus/NZ so people are used to seeing other cultures instead of what's happening here where people bitch about 3% of the country being Indian becoming 4% and claim bullshit conspiracies like "the great replacement". Even the Republicans keep saying that America is a diverse nation built on immigrants, also <strong>I've noticed how conservatives in America are less race focused and are more about unity amongst all whilst conservatives in AU/NZ/UK are more race focused and more focused on people of colour.</strong> Another thing is the quality of migrants, Americans only take the best which is why Indians, Asians, Iranians, Nigerians are highly successful and respected, over here we let anybody in to study some bs diploma mill which they then turn into PRs. Minorities here aren't exactly in many positions of power yet although that is changing. Over here when referring to somebody race "Aussie" means an anglo person, "Wog" means an Italian/Greek/Lebanese/Egyptian, "FOB" means Pacific Islander, "Asian" is EA/SEA and "Indian" is for all SA. The stereotypical Aussie is an anglo, blonde, tanned, downs 5 beers for breakfast, works as a tradie and has cigarettes for lunch. As for the UK, well it is the motherland of the Anglos so the situation there is pretty straightforward, and if they want to bitch about muslims/asians/hindus maybe they shouldn't have pillaged the entire world because the pendulum always swings back, funny how nobody bitches about European immigrants.</p>
