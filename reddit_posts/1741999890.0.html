                    <div class="content"><p>I see some very active users who post absolute crap here and then go on subs full of racists and post more crap there. People will click on your profile and see the incel/weirdo/straight up pathetic things you post on this sub and it just makes us all look bad.</p>

<p>Make a different account just to post on sam if you have to.</p>

<p>Some of you really need to get a grip. Don't just post videos of people being racist and don't post rambling rants. </p>
