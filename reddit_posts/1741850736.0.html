                    <div class="content"><p>Fellow Indians living or studying in the United States. I’m a foreign undergraduate student in the United States.</p>

<p>Previously, I studied at a public school on a merit based scholarship, but the racism there was intense, though not verbal. I switched to a school with more people of color and fewer students.</p>

<p>This place isn’t much different from the other, but I’ve faced verbal hate speech that exceeds all limits.</p>

<p>I posted on the state subreddit Iowa seeking help, but all I got were suggestions to leave the country or accept it as a.</p>

<p>The incident occurred near a subway and inside it. I requested video footage of the event from the manager, but I haven’t received a reply even after mentioning them on twitter</p>

<p>The school hasn’t responded either.</p>

<p>What do I need? I want the guy and his racist girlfriend identified, and he must apologize.</p>

<p>I sought help from the school’s student community and Snapchat community.</p>

<p>It’s so ironic that students only view people with skin colors opposite to theirs as people of color and think they can oppress others. These students were literally posting videos to assist illegal immigrants on how to stay hidden and avoid getting caught, yet not one student stepped up to help me.</p>

<p>The local town news overlooked my post on Twitter. I shared the post on Twitter to seek help, as people here recommended. The level of hate speech from other South Asian people on that post is wild, shifting from racism to religious hate speech. People are questioning why I didn’t knock out the guy. Wouldn’t that put my visa at risk?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Foreign students, could you please share my Twitter post? In the USA, students have school communities on Snapchat and YikYak. If you can help spread the word there, that would be useful.</strong></p>

<p>If you can crosspost in a relevant subreddit, please do it.</p>
