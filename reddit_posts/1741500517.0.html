                    <div class="content"><p>20M, So lately I've been feeling like shit, and I know why, It's because I've been eating unhealthy shit, seeing ragebait on Instagram, not working out, and I've been beating my dick a lot, I haven't been locking in at University, and I ain't talking to no women(I don't know how). I am starting Semen Retention today, everybody has different things to say about Semen Retention, but lowkey, I believe it helps, I believe if I stop beating my meat, I can lock in better during homework, and my mind can be much more clearer, improved gym performance, and I would feel much better about myself and I can finally get some huzz, and I need some tips for whenever I get urges, because everytime I try to start Semen Retention, my horny ass always fails, this shit has to change. Now mind you, I still go to the gym from time to time and manage to get most of my homework done, but with Semen Retention, I believe my focus and productivity will increase more. If you have any tips, feel free to share, and if you want to talk about anything or just need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me.</p>
