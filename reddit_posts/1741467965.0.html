                    <div class="content"><p>This is a bit of an emotional write up for me, so bear with me here. </p>

<p>Maturity is when you realize that Vijay Mallya was the good guy and the Indian government is the one working hard to keep us down. </p>

<p>The Indian government hated him because he showed Indians how to live life to the fullest. He showed Indians that there is a life far beyond their current bug men existence. He showed us there is no dignity in living like ants. </p>

<p>He brought us India's first and only F1 team. Sahara Force, which was largely funded by his airline, KingFisher. And a damn good team it was. In every race two Indian flags crossing the finish line one after the other. Sometimes 2nd and 3rd, sometimes 3rd and 4th, and sometimes 4th and 5th. But predominantly in the top 5 positions for sure! </p>

<p>They balled on a budget too! Other teams were in shock and awe at how this team could be so good at such a low cost! They brought us several happy moments on a budget, and happy moments are priceless. </p>

<p>But this glory was short lived as the Indian government wanted some stupid loan money from Vijay Mallya and KingFisher. Lawsuits went on for years, but eventually KingFisher went out of business, taking Sahara Force with it. </p>

<p>We lost a really good team cuzz the Indian chutiya government decided they wanted to be greedy loan sharks. Had they realized the value that Mallya was bringing to the country in terms of giving us an F1 team, they would have worked with him about the loans. But nah these sarkari chutiyas were too dumb to see past their noses. </p>

<p>We lost a really god F1 team, the drivers got poached by other teams, and most importantly we lost a pipeline for Indian drivers looking to get into F1 racing. It's a damn shame! Absolute shame! All because of the short sightedness of the Ind government. Total chutiyas and suckers. A big loss of soft power. Very low eq behavior tbh. </p>

<p>The Indian government shits on us everyday, but Vija Mallya flipped the script and served these babus their own medicine of deceit. I salute him for that tbh. You should absolutely scan a government that scams you everyday. </p>

<p>Vijay Mallya was the good guy he's been made to seem like a big criminal now but don't buy it folks. He's the good guy here it's the Indian government that's the chutiya and it always has been. </p>
