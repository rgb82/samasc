                    <div class="content"><p>This is a bit of a scrambled discussion/rant so forgive me for jumping between different points of matter but I feel like I need to address this. I've been following the recent news development surrounding the racial attack on a 67 year old nurse Leelama Lal by an absolute white american POS whose name I won't mention because frankly this cunt doesn't deserve any publicity. Apart from a few news outlets (majority from Indian broadcasters) I am boggled to find that there have barely been any mention or noise made about this incident. This is following the death of Jhanvi Kandula in 2023 by a cop which has been mostly swept under the rug, and from latest news it seems like the only reprimanded handed to the cop was being fired by the Department in 2025 and being fined $5000.</p>

<p>Is this a joke? Are we considered that low by western society that attacks on us are barely worth mentioning? Living in Australia, the media was recently washed up by the firing of two nurses for making anti-semitic statements on a video recording. About 9 years ago an indian bus driver was set alight by a "mentally ill" man who was later admitted to a mental institution. Not much coverage.  No one cared.</p>

<p>When are we going to stand up to this? Unfortunately south asian social dynamics are already split due to political and religious tensions (India/Pakistan, Hindus vs Christians vs Muslims) but outside of the subcontinent none of the west actually gaf. They all think we're the same subhuman trash that deserve to be expendible, dispensible and disrespected. This is like European colonisation tactics of pitting us against each other so that we remain divided whilst they laugh at us, and brainrot our women through media and stereotypes to see us as inferior and instead pursue western/european men. Unless we put aside our differences, stand up and support our people this will still continue.</p>

<p>I know that our patriarchal culture can harbour harmful values and treatment that was conditioned to us by generations and generations of our parents, but we now have the opportunity to break that cycle, and instead of putting down each other and our women we can treat each other with love and respect. The fight against racism is long but we can win if we're united. Whether this will happen or not, unfortunately I feel that it is still difficult to attain within this generation. </p>
