                    <div class="content"><p>I feel like my Indian accent holds me back quite a bit when talking to western women. I was wondering if I pretended not to know the language and just spoke in Hindi and used Google Translate to communicate, would it result in a better experience? </p>

<p>Also thinking of wearing traditional Indian clothes a lot more instead of plain western clothes. </p>

<p>If anyone has given these two things a shot, how did it go?</p>
