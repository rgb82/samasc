                    <div class="content"><p>I want to share this quote with everyone because it will truly change you. Nietzsche inspired me to write this quote. 
“Defeatism is the antithesis to ardour, and to survive the agony is the antithesis of defeatism”. 
My Idea and concept behind writing this: 
 - Accepting and embracing defeatism gets one nowhere in life, one of the pursuits of life is power in its various forms. Power to surpass and survive your current being, to fulfil your will to become superior in all realms of human endeavour. This period of your life is brutal as it breaks the shell you currently are in. There is humiliation that zaps away your acidity. However, the one who espouses this phase of humiliation and comes out on the other end is the man worthy of respect. It is the antidote to all your issues. 
Embrace suffering, beyond your current engagement point. Let suffering be the failed assailant as your vigour becomes your greatest line of defence. </p>
