                    <div class="content"><p>This guy (Auspilled) is basically gonna become an Australian Nick Fuentes the way he's going. But it did demonstrate to me something interesting. Conservatism in Australia is more focused on keeping the cultural identity of Australia White, hence the recent White Australia Policy which many people today were still alive back then. Meanwhile conservatism in the USA is more focused on keeping the cultural identity of America Christian and united regardless of race. Australia is around 15% more white than the US overall and the cultural identity here is still very anglo, can't say the same about the US when POC have been part of America for 100s of years. He clearly thinks Australia/America should be white even though they slaughtered and enslaved the Indigenous people for years. It's never Indigenous people spouting views on ethno-centric migration, it's always the ones that are a product of the colonisation.</p>
