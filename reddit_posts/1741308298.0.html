                    <div class="content"><p>So I'm not trying to be some kind of a positivity police nor am I trying to distract from the shitty public perception that we have, but I don't really appreciate this space being too blckpilled. </p>

<p><strong>Recently (two months ago) there was a massive race war on twitter in which a Mexican radfem posted this:</strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/w3f33hnt15ne1.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c02c6ab93d14fcbd7119b6ede1c2291ef67e703">Mexican Rad fem's tweet: 250k likes</a></p>

<p>These people are really original aren't they? This sounds really familiar. Remember the <strong>SlugCharmer</strong> tweet from 7 years ago? That bish said something like, "Indian men snuck on earth" and it got <strong>40k likes</strong> and lots of approval from other women.</p>

<p>This Mexican radfem's tweet got 250k likes, which honestly <strong>doesn't mean jack shit</strong> because it was boosted by bots (since twitter is mostly bots now), and it got boosted by <strong>black</strong> twitter (they seem to hate us for some reason). </p>

<p>But what I did not expect though, was that under this Mexican radfem's tweet was a bunch of support for Indian guys and a bunch of people roasting her and calling out her racism in the replies. A lot of women even started posting pics of themselves with their Indian bfs which I thought was wholesome asf. </p>

<p>This was something that was totally not at all seen during the slugcharmer incident. <strong>I must say that even I (formerly blckpilled) was pleasantly surprised! I never thought I'd see it this many people supporting Indian guys. Take a look:</strong> </p>
