                    <div class="content"><p>I know that the diaspora and the mainland Indians are vastly different from each other, but that doesn’t matter much because in the west, they see us as the same, and I am sick and tired of answering questions to strangers about random stereotypes about India, it’s time to change that, I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t want my people to be ashamed of their brownness, I want people to be confident about their culture and people, I want others to have a positive impression of Indians and of India, but right now, it’s the opposite. The only way to fix that is to fix India’s problems, Easier said than done, but it is for the greater good, and with the right amount of money and the right amount of effort and people, it might be possible, so here’s my plan on fixing India</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hygiene and Social Etiquette , now I know that hygiene and cleanliness varies around the country, but it’s not a good look when people’s first thoughts of India is that it’s Dirty and unhygienic, I want this to change, I mean back then, we were master plumbers, how is Medieval India better than modern day India, when I get rich, I am gonna fund organizations that clean up the country and make it look more lives Le and attractive, and encourage people to do the same, after all, it is our land, if you disrespect the land, the land will disrespect you, now I get that poorer areas might be less hygienic, BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE POOR DOESN’T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE DIRTY, at least have the decency to pick up your trash and throw it in the trash can, and don’t think you are too superior to do it, YOU DON’T HAVE SHIT TO YOUR NAME, IT IS YOUR LAND JUST AS MUCH AS IT IS YOUR NEIGHBOR’S, TAKE CARE OF THE LAND AND THE LAND WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU, MISTREAT THE LAND, AND THE LAND WILL MISTREAT YOU, and clean up the Ganges river, and teach the young about the importance of cleanliness and hygiene, maybe even some hygiene and social etiquette classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that there are programs or classes that emphasize the importance of physical fitness, I have seen far too many brown people neglect physical exercise and it only bites them in the ass later on in life when they have health problems because they ate too much junk food and didn’t exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Get rid of corruption, now I know this is not gonna be possible alone, it has to take the entire country to do that, which is why I’m gonna get help when I have the means to help my country, get rid of nepotism, all that crap which holds society back</p></li>
<li><p>Ethnic conflicts, I don’t really know how to solve this, you’d think that India’s diversity would be a strength, but all it’s done is lead to arguments over dumb bullshit like religion, caste, and language, when we’re all brown at the end of the day, just different shades, Ever since the white man stepped into the land, nothing good has ever happened, we need to fix that</p></li>
<li><p>Scammers, I really don’t know how we are gonna deal with this issue, but I’m sure we can figure it out if we think about it, and the mainlanders should be a lot nicer to tourists and to women in general, too many brown mfs see a white female tourist and don’t know how to act, this shit not only brings down the reputation of your country, but to the people everywhere, so please, be decent and well mannered, and stop trying to screw people over, it’s just not worth it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know all this is gonna take time due to the vast population of India, but I think if everyone works together and is willing to listen, then things will be good, we got a lot of young folks, but they want to move out due to how bad it is, and due to this, India loses a lot of potential to make it a more advanced and livable country, and is falling behind and stuck in the past while it’s neighboring countries which were relatively in the same status have progressed and developed further, I don’t even gotta point anywhere else, just look at China, they got their shit together and are creating technology and living in the future, while we are still in the same predicament we were in before if not worse, and our people are getting slandered everywhere, THIS HAS TO STOP, it is up to us to change the world. If you have anything to add to this, feel free to chime in.</p>
