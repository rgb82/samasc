<p>I'm a Mallu Christian myself but I understand that no matter how much you try and be like them (christian white nationalist far right) and follow their religion too you will never be one of them, for some reason this guy is Filipino (that's weird) but people always see race first. This is particularly relevant to Christian and Muslim desis, it doesn't matter if a you follow the white mans religion (it's actually not white but has seemed to be considered as one now) the WS nationalist ones won't even see you as human, for them it is race &gt; religion. I actually remember that bible verse they have I believe it's called "Fuck thy brown person", (even though Jesus was. brown). Same with Muslim desis, a lot of Arabs will typically not see you as equal, it's the harsh truth, look at how labourers are treated in the gulf. The prophet said "An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, but what you say there is the exact opposite. </p>
