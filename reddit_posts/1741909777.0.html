                    <div class="content"><p>I finally admit it, I hate myself, why, because I am brown, I hate myself because this world hates people like me, I hate myself because of the color of my skin and hair, I hate myself because this government thrives on pitting people against each other, I hate myself because I believe this girl wouldn't have rejected me if I was white, Its hard to hate myself and be happy at the same time, I hate myself because I see brown people embarass themselves everyday, I hate myself because our people are looked at as a joke, maybe if our people were finally getting better representation and are dating more interracially, I would be happier and less self hating, but no, I hate myself, thanks for trying to help me guys, I hate myself because my motherland is looked at as dirty and poor, I hate myself because the culture sucks and is backwards, I hate myself because our people behave so slimy towards tourists, I hate myself because my people are so proud when they have nothing to be proud of.</p>
