                    <div class="content"><p>What’s up guys,</p>

<p>Any men or women here who went into the trades? What were the reactions from your parents? Did they eventually be okay with the fact that you went the trade route?</p>

<p>I dropped out of Uni back in 2021 and went into business in the automotive field. My parents were very against this. That venture ended up flopping at the end of 2023.</p>

<p>Now they want me to go back to uni, but I just can’t do it. I worked at a bank last year and I’ve realized that a “white-collar” job isn’t for me.</p>

<p>I most definitely have an entrepreneurial mindset to things, and I see a huge opportunity in the trades…. But my parents just don’t see it, and they hit me with the classic “what will
other people say?”</p>

<p>Have you guys dealt with a situation like this? How have you managed with it?</p>
