                    <div class="content"><p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>Just wanted to make a post about my experience growing up as a Pakistani (22M) in Canada and the things I have learned throughout the last few years:</p>

<ol>
<li>The importance of learning about your own history</li>
</ol>

<p>The first thing that you need to understand is that without knowledge of your own history and people, you will never be able to fully appreciate yourself and where you come from. In the last year, I really tried my best to learn about the history of the Indian subcontinent and now understand the basics from a mostly unbiased view. Without this knowledge, I do not think I would be remotely confident in who I am as a “Brown” man. I am 100% certain that without this knowledge, you will not be “whole.” I want everyone here to watch a video about Lee Kuan Yew (the founder of Singapore) about not becoming a white washed Asian, and I really believe it can help.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Appreciation of your own culture</li>
</ol>

<p>For a long time throughout my life, I was even ashamed of wearing “Shalwar Kameez”, the traditional clothing men wear heavily in Pakistan because I had some sort of hatred towards it. Only last year did I wonder why I was so opposed to wearing anything from my own culture and only wearing the regular old hoodie and track pant combo. I even began to appreciate the food again, I always loved the food, but last year I started to go to more Pakistani/Indian restaurants as well. I know a lot of people from the subcontinent, particularly India, are getting shit on because of the food looking like s*!?. However we have one of, if not the best cuisine on the planet. So if you do not have some pride in these aspects about you, you will suffer tremendously.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Acknowledge the shortcomings of your own culture and try to improve but do not believe “white” culture is the superior one</li>
</ol>

<p>I see a lot of people, and I myself was affected trying to follow Western values e.t.c. There is nothing wrong with the fact that you come from a culture that really values family, education, e.t.c. In western culture, for example, it is completely normal to go to the beach with your family and the women are wearing bikinis with their shit right in front of you. Do NOT ever think that their culture is 100% superior to yours, learn about the good aspects of it that you can adopt while still keeping your own.</p>

<p>Ok, just a quick one for today, all the best</p>
